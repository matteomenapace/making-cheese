# Raw almond *feta*

Based on Miyoko Shinner's recipe from [The Homemade Vegan Pantry](https://www.google.co.uk/shopping/product/15771574996979029873)

Yields: XX g of *cheese* (to-be-discovered).

## Ingredients

Name | Quantity
---- | --------
blanched almonds | 2 cups 
[rejuvelac](../rejuvelac) | 1 cup
salt | 1/2 tsp
agar powder | 2 tbsp
water | 2/3 cup

### Brine

Name | Quantity
---- | --------
salt | 3/4 cup
water | 6 cups 

## Tools

* Bowl/jar, to soak the almonds
* Blender
* Container/jar with non-permeable lid, for the almond+rejuvelac mixture culture
* Pan, to prepare the agar+water mixture
* Cheese-cloth
* Cheese mould (or a strainer) 
* Bowl (large) for the brine
* Cloth to cover the brine bowl

## Method

Step 	| Description | Duration | Notes
---- 	| ----------- | -------- | ----- 
1		| Soak the almonds | 12 to 24 hours
2		| Blanch the almonds if they aren't blanched already. | | This is a tedious and time-consuming task: it may take ~3-10 seconds per almond, and you have 100+ to peel. Consider getting the almonds already blanched. <br><br>Pouring boiling water over the soaked almonds makes the blanching much faster, [see video](https://youtu.be/2hqAUFf9RZ8?t=42s)
3		| Drain and rinse the almonds. 
4 		| Blend almonds, rejuvelac and salt. | 1-2 minutes | Until smooth an no longer grainy
5 		| Pour the mixture into a container and cover with a non-permeable lid. | | *The mixture shouldn't breathe, hence the non-permeable lid?*
6		| Leave the mixture to **culture** | 1-2 days | Taste it regularly, until it begins to get **tangy**. In warmer weather it could take just a day, while in colder weather it could be 2 days or even more.
7		| Line a mould with cheese-cloth | | *Dimensions?* 8		| In a pan, mix water + agar powder and whisk ||
9 		| Cover with a lid and simmer, until it bubbles. | 4-5 minutes | The mixture may seem to solidify after ~2 minutes. If you let it simmer over low heat for a couple more minutes it will liquify again and bubble away. <br><br>At this point it may be good to test squeezing the water out of the culture, before mixing in the melted agar
10		| Pour the liquified agar into the almond+rejuvelac culture and combine
11		| Pour the mixture into the cheese-cloth lined mould/strainer | | It needs to breathe and lose the moist. *Maybe it doesn't need the container, just the cheese-cloth.*
12		| Refrigerate until hard | Several hours | *How many? How hard?* More than a day, and it was still moist (see notes below). *Maybe it doesn't need to stay in the fridge*
13		| In a large bowl, mix together water and salt (see [brine](#brine) quantities) | |
14		| Cut the cheese into a few pieces (eg 4) and place it in the brine | | 
15 	| Cover with a cloth and let sit. | *8 hours?*

## Experiments

### Batch 1

* 08.08.2015
	* Measured 1 cup of dry almonds (and then halved the other ingredients). It's not clear yet if the 2 cups measure refers to dry or soaked. Soaked almonds are heavier and more voluminous than dry ones.
* 09.08.2015
	* Used fresh quinoa rejuvelac (just drained from the sprouts)
	* The mixture came out a bit grainy and not as smooth as it could (due to blender not working well with small quantities)
	* Left to culture for ~30 hours (morning 09.08 - afternoon 10.08), average temperature ~26C
	![](culture-batch-01.jpg)
* 10.08.2015
	* After pouring the agar+almond+rejuvelac mixture into a cloth-lined container, covered it with a non-permeable lid and placed it in the fridge (*temperature?*)  
	![](solidify-batch-01.jpg)
* 11.08.2015 
	* Kept in the fridge for ~20 hours, and it hadn't solidified. It was slightly harder than the day before, but still rather soft (say, like a ricotta) and moist. Probably because of the lid.
	* Removed the lid and placed it back in the fridge. 
* 12.08.2015 
	* After a day, the mixture has solidified a bit (although is not nearly as hard as traditional feta), so took it out of the fridge and into the brine	 
	* A few (~3) hours into the brine and the pieces were melting away, so took it out and place it in a container. Consistency: like a spread.
	* Experiment failed, it's nothing like feta, but the spread was decent (a little too tangy though).


### Batch 2

* 09.08.2015
	* Soaked almonds (2 cups, measured dry)
* 10.08.2015
	* Used refrigerated quinoa rejuvelac (one day in the fridge), and slightly more than a cup (~1.2 cups) to get the mixture smoother.
	* Left to culture for ~24 hours (morning 10.08 - morning 11.08), average temperature ~26C
* 11.08.2015
	* Placed the agar+almond+rejuvelac mixture into a cloth-lined container and in the fridge (without lid)
	* After 6 hours in the fridge, flipped the cheese mould upside down and soaked up a bit of moisture with kitchen paper
	![](solidify-batch-02.jpg)
* 13.08.2015 
	* Still quite moist and not hard at all: if you tried to cut it it wouldn't keep its shape.
	* 16:00: changed the cheesecloth and placed it in the oven at ~40C, without container. The aim is to dry it up as much as possible, so it may take a few hours
	* Moisture seems to be a big problem. Possible solutions: 
		* squeezing the moisture out of the almond+rejuvelac culture before mixing in the agar powder
		* activating the agar properly, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa8rA7hT5dc)
		* use a container that can let the cheese breathe (maybe on a slanted surface to let the liquid get away)
	* Left it in the oven for 5 hours: a slightly darker rind started to form and the whole thing was a bit more solid and dry. Tasted very tangy (too much rejuvelac?)
	![](oven-batch-02.jpg)
	* 21:30: wrapped it in new cheese cloth and place it on a grid at room temperature (~26C)	
* 14.08.2015
	* 11:30 sprinkled salt flakes on the cheese cloth to dry the moisture out

### Byproducts

What could be done with the following?

* Water from soaked almonds
* Almond skins

### TODO

- [ ] Try juice from sauerkraut instead of rejuvelac
- [ ] Measures in g / ml instead of cups?
