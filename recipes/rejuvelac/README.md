# Rejuvelac (quinoa)

> A non-alcoholic fermented liquid made from sprouted grains. 

> Because it is fermented, Rejuvelac contains beneficial bacteria and active enzymes, and thus it can improve digestion of food.

> From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvelac)

Yields about 4 cups.

Based on Miyoko Shinner's recipe, and [this video](https://youtu.be/B693ZIdF_3oo)

Gone bad...

# Batch 3

* 15.09.2015
    * 18:30: soaked 100g of white quinoa (by Despar, not organic) in cold water

* 16.09.2015
    * 09:30: rinsed to let it sprout, leaving a couple spoons of water in so that seeds don't dry out	
    14:00: rinsed again
    20:00: rinsed once more, very little sprouting going on

* 17.09.2015
    13:00: some sprouts, decided to move on to the next step and covered with fresh water

* 19.09.2015 
    09:00: liquid is bubbly and cloudy, smells like rejuvelac, let's bottle it	


# Batch 4

* 18.09.2015
    * 20:30: soaked 50g of white quinoa (by Ecor, organic) in cold water

* 19.09.2015

* 21.09.2015
    * 14:30: bubbly and cloudy with almost all seeds sprouted, let's bottle it and then fill it with new water to start a new batch..

### Byproducts

What could be done with the following?

* Sprouted quinoa: [this maybe?](http://www.mynewroots.org/site/2008/01/organic-garden-in-your-kitchen-2/)

### TODO

- [ ] How many batches of rejuvelac can you make with one batch of quinoa seeds? How does the resulting rejuvelac change?
- [ ] How does the rejuvelac change when kept in the fridge?
