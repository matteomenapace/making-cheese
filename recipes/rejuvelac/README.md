# Rejuvelac (quinoa)

> A non-alcoholic fermented liquid made from sprouted grains. 

> Because it is fermented, Rejuvelac contains beneficial bacteria and active enzymes, and thus it can improve digestion of food.

> From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuvelac)

Yields about 4 cups.

### Byproducts

What could be done with the following?

* Sprouted quinoa: [this maybe?](http://www.mynewroots.org/site/2008/01/organic-garden-in-your-kitchen-2/)

### TODO

- [ ] How many batches of rejuvelac can you make with one batch of quinoa seeds? How does the resulting rejuvelac change?
- [ ] How does the rejuvelac change when kept in the fridge?
