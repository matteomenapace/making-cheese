# Raw almond *cheese*

This is supposed to become a yummy vegan raw *feta*.

Yields: XX g of *cheese* (to-be-discovered).

## Ingredients

Name | Quantity
---- | --------
blanched almonds | 2 cups 
[rejuvelac](../rejuvelac) | 1 cup
salt | 1/2 tsp
agar powder | 2 tbsp
water | 2/3 cup

### Brine

Name | Quantity
---- | --------
salt | 3/4 cup
water | 6 cups 

## Tools

* Bowl (to soak almonds)
* Blender
* Container with non-permeable lid (for the almond+rejuvelac mixture culture)
* Pan (to prepare the agar+water mixture)
* Cheese-cloth

## Method

Step 	| Description | Duration | Notes
---- 	| ----------- | -------- | ----- 
1		| Soak the almonds | 12 to 24 hours
2		| Blanch thee almonds if they aren't blanched already. | | This is a tedious and time-consuming task: it may take ~3-10 seconds per almond, and you have 100+ to peel). Consider getting the almonds already blanched
3		| Drain and rinse the almonds. 
4 		| Blend almonds, rejuvelac and salt. | 1-2 minutes | Until smooth an no longer grainy
5 		| Pour the mixture into a container and cover with a non-permeable lid. | | The mixture shouldn't breathe, hence the non-permeable lid?
6		| Leave the mixture to *culture* | 1-2 days | Taste it regularly, until it begins to get *tangy*. In warmer weather it could take just a day, while in colder weather it could be 2 days or even more.
7		| Line a container with cheese-cloth | | Dimensions? 
8		| In a pan, mix water + agar powder and whisk ||
9 		| Cover with a lid and simmer, until it bubbles. | 3-4 minutes | The mixture may seem to solidify after ~2 minutes. If you let it simmer over low heat for a couple more minutes it will liquify again and bubble away
10		| Pour the liquified agar into the almond+rejuvelac culture and combine
11		| Pour the mixture into the cheese-cloth lined container | | Close it hermetically?
12		| Refrigerate until hard | Several hours | How many?

## Experiments

### Batch 1

* Started on 08.08.2015.
* Measured 1 cup of dry almonds (and then halved the other ingredients). It's not clear yet if the 2 cups measure refers to dry or soaked. Soaked almonds are heavier and more voluminous than dry ones.
* Used fresh quinoa rejuvelac (just drained from the sprouts)
* The mixture came out a bit grainy and not as smooth as it could (due to blender not working well with small quantities)
* Left to culture for ~30 hours (morning 09.08 - afternoon 10.08), average temperature ~26C

* After pouring the agar+almond+rejuvelac mixture into a cloth-lined container, covered it with a non-permeable lid and placed it in the fridge (temperature?)

### Batch 2

* Started on 09.08.2015.
* Used refrigerated quinoa rejuvelac (one day in the fridge), and slightly more than a cup (~1.2 cups) to get the mixture smoother.

### Byproducts

What could be done with the following?

* Water from soak almonds
* Almond skins

### TODO

- [ ] Try juice from sauerkraut instead of rejuvelac
- [ ] Measures in g / ml instead of cups?
