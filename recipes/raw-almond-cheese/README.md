## Method

1		| Soak the almonds | 12 to 24 hours
2		| Blanch thee almonds if they aren't blanched already.
3		| Drain and rinse the almonds. 
4 		| Blend almonds, rejuvelac and salt. | 1-2 minutes | Until smooth an no longer grainy
5 		| Pour the mixture into a container and cover with a non-permeable lid. | | The mixture shouldn't breathe, hence the non-permeable lid?

## Experiments

### Batch 1

* Started on 08.08.2015.
* Measured 1 cup of dry almonds (and then halved the other ingredients). It's not clear yet if the 2 cups measure refers to dry or soaked. Soaked almonds are heavier and more voluminous than dry ones.
* Used fresh quinoa rejuvelac (just drained from the sprouts)
* Left to culture for ~30 hours, average temperature ~26C


### Batch 2

* Started on 09.08.2015.
* Used refrigerated quinoa rejuvelac (one day in the fridge), and slightly more than a cup (~1.2 cups) to get the mixture smoother.

### Byproducts

What could be done with the following?

* Water from soak almonds
* Almond skins

### TODO

- [ ] Try juice from sauerkraut instead of rejuvelac
- [ ] Measures in g / ml instead of cups?
